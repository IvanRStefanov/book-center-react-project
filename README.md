# Book Center is a student project made with no commmercial intent! Any names, pictures, information and content are used only with the intent to practice React!

### To run the project locally simply clone the repository or download it. And then follow these steps:
1. In the client folder open a new terminal and execute the following code to start the front-end server:
    1. ``npm i`` - this will install all the dependencies needed;
    2. ``npm run dev`` - this will start the server at `` http://localhost:5173/``
2. In the server folder open a new terminal and execute the following code:
    1. ``node .\server.js`` - this will start the back-end and the collections can be reviewed at ```http://localhost:3030/admin/```

The server comes with prepopulated data and pre-made users:
- peter@abv.bg: 123456
- george@abv.bg: 123456
- maria@abv.bg: 123456

### **For this project the back-end server in use is [SoftUni Practice Server](https://github.com/softuni-practice-server/softuni-practice-server) For more information about it's functionalities visit the link above.**
